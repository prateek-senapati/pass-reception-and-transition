    "# Pass Reception and Transition\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key skills in a midfielder is the ability to drop back into her defensive half for receiving passes and subsequently transitioning the play to their attacking zones. The objective of this exploratory analysis is to study the same. We are going to find such ball progressing midfielders from the FA Women’s Super League 2020-21 season and analyse them. For this analysis, we are going to use event data provided by StatsBomb and 'minutes played' data provided by FBref.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before heading into the analysis, here are some important details related to the data and some rules which we are going to use to model such ball progressing sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are going to use a pitch configuration where the the pitch is divided into 18 zones, with 6 zones in each third of the pitch. For reference, here's an image of the same pitch configuration by [The Coaches' Voice](https://www.coachesvoice.com/):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a pass reception to be considered in this analysis, it must satisfy the following conditions:\n",
    "    - The pass should be successfully received by a midfielder in zones 4-9.\n",
    "    - The pass must have started in zones 1-9, i.e. the defensive half.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A transition following a pass reception is considered successful if it satisfies the following conditions:\n",
    "    - The transition must end in the final/attacking third, i.e. zones 13-18.\n",
    "    - The transition can involve 2 players at max (the first of which is the player who receives the pass). The idea behind this is:<br>\n",
    "    > A midfielder, after receiving the pass in her own half, will want to move the ball into her attacking half. She can either carry the ball or pass the ball or do both to make the ball reach their attacking third - all on her own. Another option for her is to pass the ball to one of her teammates who is open and has the space and time to move the ball into the attacking third.\n",
    "    >\n",
    "    > In the second case, the first player saw an opportunity for progressing the ball through the second player and hence made the decision to pass the ball. Therefore, I want to give some credit to the first player because she made a decision depending on which of her teammates is open and has a higher probability of moving the ball forward. But if we add a third player, then the first player might not play a big role in the third player's decision making - the uncertainty will increase here. In other words, the first player is more certain of the second player's available choices and possible outcomes than she is for the third player.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The transition can have a maximum of 4 events. Here's the reason why:<br>\n",
    "    > There are 2 major events in any transition - a pass and a carry. Based on numerous samples clips I watched, the most common transitions (into the attacking third) involving 2 players can be completed in 4 events - for example, player #1 carries (event count = 1) and passes (event count = 2) the ball to player #2 who then carries (event count = 3) and passes (event count = 4) the ball into the attacking third. Other examples might involve less number of events. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are the rules which are used to count events in our analysis:\n",
    "    - A successful pass of any length is counted as an event and the final location of the pass is recorded (to check if the ball has reached the attacking third).\n",
    "    - A successful carry is counted as an event only when the carry distance is more than 5 metres (or 5.46807 yards - since StatsBomb coordinate data is in yards). The carry end location is also recorded. \n",
    "    - If a successful carry's length is less than or equal to 5 metres then it is not counted as an event but its end location is recorded.\n",
    "    - Events like dispossession, miscontrol, block, interception, clearance, unsuccessful pass, unsuccessful dribble, shot, foul will break the transition.\n",
    "    - If there's a successful dribble between two successful carries, then both the carries will be combined for 'event count' and 'ball location' calculation.\n",
    "    - All other events like duels and ball recoveries are ignored since those are covered by one of the above events/rules related to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- StatsBomb's pitch configuration is 120 yards long, i.e. the x-coordinate is from 0-120. Here are the x-coordinates for different areas of the pitch discussed above:\n",
    "    - The Ball Reception Area (Zones 4-9): 20 < x < 60\n",
    "    - The Pass Start Area (Defensive Half / Zones 1-9): x < 60\n",
    "    - The Attacking/Final Third (Zones 13-18): x >= 80\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- After preparing the data for our analysis, as a final step, we'll only keep those midfielders who have played at least 450 minutes (equivalent to 5 full matches) during the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereafter, all mentions of pass/ball receptions and successul/unsuccessful transitions will refer to the above definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the conditions and rules defined, let's dive into the code and analyse our findings!\n",
