# Pass Reception and Transition: Identifying Ball-Progressing Midfielders

One of the key skills of a midfielder is the ability to drop back into her defensive half to receive passes and subsequently transition the play to her attacking third via ball-progressing [sequences](https://www.statsperform.com/resource/introducing-a-possessions-framework/). Transitions like these can increase a team's chances of scoring more goals and winning games. Therefore, it's essential for teams to have midfielders who can execute these transitions effectively. 

Here's an [example clip](https://youtu.be/K6AZekdTNcI?si=5EFkmfsL18A4E1Mx&t=5284):

> Observe how at 58:37, So-Yun Ji (# 10) positions herself to receive the pass from Magdalena Eriksson. She checks her shoulder to gauge incoming pressure and evaluate her possible options. Ji then passes the ball to the left wing, where Hannah Blundell (# 3) is open, knowing that Hannah can either carry or pass the ball into the attacking third. Hannah finally passes the ball to Sam Kerr (# 20), who receives it in the attacking third to complete the transition.

The objective of this analysis is to identify such ball-progressing midfielders from the FA Womenâ€™s Super League (WSL) 2020-21 season and analyze them. This analysis uses event data provided by [StatsBomb](https://statsbomb.com/news/statsbomb-release-free-2020-21-fa-womens-super-league-data-updated-r-guide/) and 'minutes played' data provided by [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/comps/189/2020-2021/playingtime/2020-2021-Womens-Super-League-Stats).
