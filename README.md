One of the key skills of a midfielder is the ability to drop back into her defensive half for receiving passes and subsequently transitioning the play to their attacking zones.

This analysis uses event data provided by StatsBomb and 'minutes played' data provided by FBref. You can find the analyis [here](pass_reception_and_transition.ipynb).
